		Twitter, <a href="the_facebook_papers.htm">Facebook</a> and
		others have all taken over the majority of human interaction
		online, and profit off of selling our attention to the highest
		bidder. There is another, more insidious side (if that's even
		possible) to this, in that this can also be used to drown out
		narratives that aren't conducive to the status quo, as well as
		push agendas that do. We must always be on guard and have the
		<a href="sift_method.htm">SIFT Method</a> ready when seeing
		extraordinary claims or emotionally-heated topics trending
		online.

		Although one does wonder if there is an alternative to all of
		this. And, like most things related to software, an open standard
		has already been defined for the usecase of just wanting to read
		the goddamn news or blogs of friends and interesting people.

		RSS or "Really Simple Syndication", among other things, is a way for
		websites, normally news sites and blogs, to send content out as a
		feed. And yes, "feed" in this context is the same as the Twitter and
		Facebook kinds. But the feed is ultimately generated and curated by
		the algorithms that the megacorps control.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		RSS gets rid of all that crap by simply taking a list
		of feeds, usually just links to XML files served over
		the internet, and then just displays the posts to you
		in chronological order. The only time <a
		href="ai_weirdness.htm"> AI </a> was ever needed in
		creating a feed like this is for manipulating and
		selling peoples' attention.

		<h4>Get yourself a feed reader</h4>

		<p>For Mobile (F-Droid Links)</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>
			<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ru.yanus171.feedexfork/">

		</ul>
		<p>
		    Both of them support offline reading and background synchronization,
		    which are the features that one should look for in an RSS reader.

		<p>For the UNIX (Linux, *BSD's, etc) command line</p>

		    I personally use

		    <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">
			Elfeed
		    </a>

		    and

		    <a href="https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org">
			Elfeed-Org
		    </a>

		    to manage and browser RSS feeds from within Emacs
		    as I spend most of my personal computing time
		    within it.

		<h4>Find yourself some feeds</h4>

		<p>
		    After you have your RSS feed reader set up, it's
		    time to fill the feed with content. Go to your
		    favorite blogs and look for this symbol:
		</p>

		<img alt="" src="/media/rss-icon.png">rss-icon</img>

		<p>
		    Or they might say something like "Subscribe via RSS" like this blog
		    does. If you click on either, your RSS reader should pick it up or you
		    get prompted to select your RSS reader to open said link.

		<h4>Getting RSS feeds from Youtube, Reddit, etc</h4>

		<p>
		    Being a link aggregator, getting RSS feeds from
		    Reddit is fairly simple, just add
		    <code>.rss</code> to the end of the subreddit or
		    even username link, like so:
		</p>

		<p>
		    <code>https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/.rss</code>
		</p>

		<p>
		    And believe it or not, you can also get an RSS feed from youtube
		    channels, but it takes a bit more doing:
		</p>

		<ol>
		    <li>
			<p>
			    Go and get the Channel ID of the channel
			    you want to follow
			</p>
			<p>
			    When you open a youtube channel page,
			    there should be what looks like gibberish
			    at the end of the URL, after the `/`
			    character:
			</p>
			<p>
			    <code>
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g
=> channel id is UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g
			    </code>
			</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
			<p>
			    Append the channel ID to the link below
			</p>
			<p>
			    <code>https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=</code>
			</p>
			<p>
			    You need to add the channel ID right after
			    the <code>=</code> character, like so:
			</p>
			<p>
			    <code>https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g</code>
			</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
			<p>Add it to your chosen feed reader and enjoy!</p>
			<p>
			    Plus points if you can configure your feed reader to play youtube
			    videos in something like

			    <a href="https://github.com/Feodor2/invidious">
				Invidious
			    </a>

			    or

			    <a href="https://youtube-dl.org/"> youtube-dl </a>
			</p>
		    </li>
		</ol>

		<p>
		    But then you might ask, if I hate megacorporations
		    so much, why am I teaching folks how to get
		    content from them? Mostly because we have to face
		    the facts that these corporations and their
		    government backers have

		    <a href="class_struggle.htm">
			so much control over our lives
		    </a>,

		    both on- and offline. If there is a way we can
		    lessen their influence over us, we should take
		    it. Using RSS feeds as opposed to the
		    algorithmically-made ones fed to us by the
		    megacorps is one key step to doing that.
